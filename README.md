*DESCRIPTION OF TASK*: 
The goal of this task is to build a movie recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering with Matrix Factorization (SVD). The system predicts a user's rating for movies they haven't seen yet and recommends the top-rated ones.
We use the MovieLens 100K dataset, which contains real user ratings of movies. The model is trained on part of the dataset and evaluated using RMSE and MAE metrics.
Key features of the system:
Learns user preferences from existing ratings
Predicts unknown ratings using the SVD algorithm
Recommends top-N movies for each user based on predicted ratings
This technique is widely used in platforms like Netflix and Amazon for personalized content recommendations.
